- 👋 Hi, I’m @ITMentalist, I build bridges between IBM i and the modern world—one integration at a time.
Passionate about open-source innovation on IBM i, from RPGLE parsing to Neo4j graphing, and everything in between.
💡 Creating, contributing, and collaborating until these ideas spark enough momentum to inspire the whole community.
🔎 Always experimenting, always learning. If it runs on IBM i, I’ll find a way to make it better and easier.

Let’s make IBM i open, integrated , modern, and exciting for generations to come! 🚀

- 👀 I’m interested in 
  - Bringing Open Source to IBM i—because modern tech and legacy systems should work together, not apart.
  - Parsing and graphing RPGLE code to visualize and unlock hidden insights in code complexity.
  - Integration & automation—making the IBM i play well with everything from cloud to databases.
  - Exploring innovative solutions that simplify complex IBM i challenges.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - Neo4j & Graph Databases—mapping IBM i applications like never before.
  - Cloud integrations (Azure, IBM MQ, and beyond) to bridge IBM i with modern ecosystems.
  - Expanding Open Source tooling for IBM i, one project at a time.
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
  - IBM i Open Source projects that improve developer experience & modernization.
  - Neo4j-powered visualizations of IBM i applications.
  - pfgrep & other search tools to make IBM i development more efficient.
  - Innovative integration frameworks that connect IBM i with the rest of the IT world.
  - IBM BOB - the BEST Open Source Build tool to exist on the IBM i
